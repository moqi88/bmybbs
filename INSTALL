This BBS has been tested on x86 machine running redhat linux 6.2.
It should run on any linux system.
It perhaps will run on other Unix system.

For impatient users,

1. add a user named bbs on your system
	
   on redhat linux,just run: adduser bbs 	

2. edit /etc/passwd,change the uid and gid of the user bbs to 9999 and 99

   now your passwd file looks like this:

   bbs:x:9999:99::/home/bbs:/bin/bash

   after this,you can run: chown 9999.99 /home/bbs -R 

3. Set the password for "bbs"

3.5
   edit site/bbsconfig.sample and save it as site/bbsconfig
   edit site/seclist.txt.sample and save it as site/seclist.txt
   if you don't know what these mean,you can just copy bbsconfig.sample to bbsconfig...

   if you get souce code from our cvs
   you should run ./makedist.sh
   if it complain can't find the directory of autoconf or automake
   you can link your auto* program to the name automake or autoconf
